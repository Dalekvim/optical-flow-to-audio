# Optical Flow to Audio
The aim of this project is to produce software that can allow the visually impared to navigate the world using sound.

This project was inspired by [Daniel Kish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish) and his use of **flash sonar**.

## Basic Principle
The program takes a live camera feed and extracts information such as distance to objects, its motion relative to the client, etc, and converts that into audio.

Since the device will be used in day to day life, it is also important that it does not produce unnecesary disruption or discomfort.

Non-essential information about the sorroundings such as colour or intensity will not be conveyed directly, similar to flash sonar.
